# Awesome Jev

**Public projects that use [Jev](https://typesafe.ai/), TypeSafe AI's System One model.** Unofficial. Not affiliated with TypeSafe AI.

Jev does not chat, write code, or see images. It returns Choice, Score, or Noul answers with probabilities. Your code decides what happens next.

## Quick start

1. Docs index: [docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt](https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt)
2. Python: `uv add typesafe-sdk` · JS: `npm install @typesafe-ai/sdk` (need `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`)
3. Agent skill: `npx skills add typesafe-ai/skills --skill typesafe-ai` or Claude Code plugin `typesafe@typesafe-ai`
4. HTTP: `POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`

## Evidence

| Badge | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `code-inspected` | README plus relevant source or example files were read |
| `demo-inspected` | A documented demo, cookbook run, or live page was inspected |
| `documented-example` | Official docs/cookbook/changelog |
| `author-claim` | Author or press described it; implementation not fully inspected |
| `proposed` | Not built; see [skill opportunities](docs/skill-opportunities.md) |

Vendor speed and cost charts are not remeasured here. Treat launch-week latency and “N users” claims as marketing unless a source is marked inspected.

## Details

Actions, caveats, and sources for every entry: [docs/catalog.md](docs/catalog.md) (generated from [data/use-cases.json](data/use-cases.json)).

How the sweep was done: [research method](docs/research-method.md). Skill-shaped gaps: [skill opportunities](docs/skill-opportunities.md).

This list is smaller than auto-generated directories on purpose. It includes a full public `typesafe-ai` org inventory (10 repos: 4 product, 3 supporting, 3 unrelated forks), evidence badges, and action-taking projects first.

Gaps: the first X lane used indexed web pages (`web_search`/`web_extract` of x.com; native `x_search` was unavailable). A 2026-09-17 native `x_search` rerun added two catalog entries. Google SERP was unavailable. No TypeSafe inference in this sweep.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). PRs need a public source, an evidence level, and creator credit. Run `python3 scripts/validate.py`.

Each project credits its author or maintainer from public README, package, or repository metadata. Other [awesome-Jev lists](#other-awesome-jev-lists) are listed as lists; their curators are credited there. This catalog does not claim those projects were all found independently of those lists.
